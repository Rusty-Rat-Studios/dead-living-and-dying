## Features
- **Dynamic Horror Gameplay**: Horror elements are built into the gameplay itself and the dynamic interactions between the player and ghosts allowing for greater replayability.
- **Dark Storyline**: The game follows the story of a lone caregiver suffering from narcissistic, emotional abuse from the one they care for but cannot abandon.
- **State-Based-Interactions**: The player's and ghosts' abilities and interactions change based on how much damage the player has taken.
- **Randomly Generated Maps**: A new map is generated each playthrough so the player has to re-discover and re-strategize every playthrough.
